# Learning Game Development

This repository contains small game projects and experiments created while I learn game development and programming.

The main goal of this repo is to practice core concepts such as:
- Game loops
- Player movement
- Collision detection
- Basic game mechanics
- Clean and readable code

## Projects
Each folder contains a standalone game or experiment with its own source code.

Examples include:
- Simple 2D games
- Mechanics prototypes
- Programming exercises related to games

## Technologies
Depending on the project:
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript
- Other tools as I continue learning

## Status
This repository is a **learning project**.  
Code quality and structure improve over time as my skills grow.
